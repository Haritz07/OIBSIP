- **Login**: Visit the login page (`/login`) to log in with your registered account.
- **Logout**: Click the "Logout" button to log out and end the session.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles errors such as invalid credentials or missing fields and displays flash messages to the user.

## Customization

You can customize this application to fit your specific needs:

- **Database Integration**: If you want to store user data in a database, consider integrating a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Update the user data handling functions in `passport-config.js` accordingly.

- **Styling**: Customize the CSS styles in the `public` folder to match your application's design.

- **Routes**: Define additional routes or functionality as needed by modifying the Express router in `server.js`.

This README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, customization options, and more. You can replace placeholders like `yourusername`, `your-auth-app`, and `your_session_secret_here` with your own project-specific information. Additionally, make sure to include any specific instructions or details relevant to your application.

## Errors

I enjoyed every bit of this project as it was an interesting challenge. I unfortunately haven't been able to proerly implement the error messages yet, instead if your login credentials are incorrect or if such credentials already exist, you wouldn't be able to move past the "/login" page. ðŸ˜…
Also, the Logout functionality isn't "Functional" yet. ðŸ˜… All will be sorted soon.
